# eBPF Full Cone NAT

This eBPF application implements an "Endpoint-Independent Mapping" and "Endpoint-Independent Filtering" NAT(network address translation) on TC egress and ingress hooks.

## Requirement

-   Linux kernel >= 5.15 (compiled with BPF and BTF support) on target machine
-   `libelf` from elfutils
-   `zlib`
-   `clang` to compile BPF C code
-   `cargo` and `rustfmt` for building

## Installation

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/EHfive/bpf-full-cone-nat
```

Or build static binaries with Nix flakes we provide.

```shell
nix build github:EHfive/bpf-full-cone-nat#static-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# Cross compile for aarch64
nix build github:EHfive/bpf-full-cone-nat#static-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

## Usage

This application currently supports SNAT for IPv4 TCP/UDP/ICMP, see [config.sample.toml](./config.sample.toml) for more configuration options.

```shell
sudo bpf-full-cone-nat --config /path/to/config.toml
# or with simplified CLI options
sudo bpf-full-cone-nat --ifname eth0
```

To test if this works, you can use tools below on internal network behind NAT. Notice you could only got "Full Cone" NAT if your external network is already "Full Cone" NAT or has a public IP.

Instead of relying on existing Netfilter conntrack system like these out-of-tree kernel modules did, we implement a fully functional Endpoint Independent NAT engine on eBPF TC hook from scratch thus avoiding hassles dealing with "Address and Port-Dependent" Netfilter conntrack system and being slim and efficient.

And our application enjoys libbpf's CO-RE(Compile Once â€“ Run Everywhere) capabilities that hugely simplifies distribution and deployment.
